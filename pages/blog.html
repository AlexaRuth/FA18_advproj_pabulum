      <h2><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-46302780"> Why the world is becoming more allergic to food</a></h2>
      <h5>By Dr Alexandra Santos, Dec 1, 2018</h5>

      <p>Around the world, children are far more likely than ever before to develop food allergies. Recent inquiries into the deaths of two British teenagers after eating sesame and peanut highlighted the sometimes tragic consequences. In August, a six-year-old girl in Western Australia died as the result of a dairy allergy. The rise in allergies in recent decades has been particularly noticeable in the West. Food allergy now affects about 7% of children in the UK and 9% of those in Australia, for example. Across Europe, 2% of adults have food allergies.</p>

      <p>Life-threatening reactions can be prompted even by traces of the trigger foods, meaning patients and families live with fear and anxiety. The dietary restrictions which follow can become a burden to social and family lives. While we can't say for sure why allergy rates are increasing, researchers around the world are working hard to find ways to combat this phenomenon.</p>

      <p>Some possible explanations
      There is no single explanation for why the world is becoming more allergic to food, but science has some theories. One is that improved hygiene is to blame, as children are not getting as many infections. Parasitic infections, in particular, are normally fought by the same mechanisms involved in tackling allergies. With fewer parasites to fight, the immune system turns against things that should be harmless.</p>

      <p>Another idea is that vitamin D can help our immune system develop a healthy response, making us less susceptible to allergies. Most populations around the world do not get enough vitamin D for several reasons, including spending less time in the sun. In the US, the rate of vitamin D deficiency is thought to have almost doubled in just over a decade. A newer, "dual allergen exposure" theory, suggests food allergy development is down to the balance between the timing, dose and form of exposure. For example, the development of the allergy antibodies can take place through the skin, particularly through inflamed skin in babies with eczema.</p>

      <p>But it is thought that eating trigger foods during weaning can lead to a healthy response and prevent the allergy developing, because the gut's immune system is prepared to tolerate bacteria and foreign substances, such as food. This was the basis for King's College London's LEAP Study, which showed about an 80% reduction in peanut allergy in five-year-old children who regularly ate peanut from the year they were born.</p>

      <p>Food allergies can have serious health repercussions. An estimated 5.6 million children and adolescents suffer from a food allergy, according to new research in the journal Pediatrics, which was based on data from a nationally representative sample of 38,408 youths under age 18. And 1 out of 5 had been to the emergency room at least once in the previous year because of a severe allergic reaction. </p>
      
      <p>APeanuts rank as the most common food allergy, affecting about 1.6 million youths, followed by milk allergy, affecting 1.4 million. Other common allergens are shellfish, tree nuts, eggs, fin fish, wheat, soy and sesame. About 40 percent of the youths in the study were allergic to more than one food.</p>

      <p>Although sesame ranks as only the ninth most common allergen, 1 of every 3 kids with a sesame allergy had been to the ER in the previous year. Allergic reactions can range from mild to severe and may develop within minutes or not until a couple hours after the allergen has been consumed. Symptoms can include trouble breathing, stomach pain, itchy and watery eyes, hives, swelling, and lightheadedness, among others.</p>

      <p>The most severe reaction, a life-threatening response called anaphylaxis, can make it nearly impossible to breathe because the airway becomes swollen. Injecting the drug epinephrine counters that, which is why doctors urge anyone, young or old, who has a food allergy to always carry an auto-injector device containing the drug.</p>
