<h2>Symptoms of food intolerance</h2>

palpitations

Allergy is an immune response
Allergies are an overreaction of the body’s immune system to a protein. These proteins may be from foods, pollens, house dust, animal hair or moulds. They are called allergens. The word allergy means that the immune system has responded to a harmless substance as if it were toxic. 

Food intolerance is a chemical reaction
Food intolerance is a chemical reaction that some people have after eating or drinking some foods; it is not an immune response. Food intolerance has been associated with asthma, chronic fatigue syndrome and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

Causes of food allergy
Peanuts, tree nuts, eggs, milk, wheat, sesame, fish, shellfish and soy cause about 90 per cent of food allergic reactions. Peanut allergy is one of the most common allergies in older children as only approximately one in four children will outgrow peanut allergy.
